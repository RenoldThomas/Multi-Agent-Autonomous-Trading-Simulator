# Multi-Agent Autonomous Trading Simulator

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project simulates a **financial market** where multiple AI agents with distinct trading strategies (momentum, mean-reversion, statistical arbitrage) interact in real-time.  
The objective is to study **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**, market microstructure, and coordination dynamics in competitive environments.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a simulated trading environment with tick-level data
- Implement multiple reinforcement learning agents with unique trading strategies
- Enable **inter-agent communication** for collaborative or adversarial scenarios
- Evaluate agent performance with **PnL, Sharpe ratio, and drawdowns**

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** (3.11+)
- **RLlib** (multi-agent RL)
- **PyTorch** (deep RL models)
- **Pandas/NumPy** (data handling)
- **Gymnasium** (custom trading environment)
- **ZeroMQ / asyncio** (agent communication)

## 🧠 Key AI Concepts
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
- Adversarial RL dynamics
- Market microstructure simulation
- Low-latency decision-making

## 🔑 Implementation Steps
1. Create trading environment with synthetic or historical data
2. Define multiple agents with unique RL strategies
3. Implement real-time agent communication
4. Run simulation and compare agent performances

## ⚡ Challenges
- Designing a realistic market environment
- Avoiding overfitting to historical data
- Balancing adversarial vs. cooperative strategies

## 📊 Results (To Be Added)
- Performance metrics
- Visualizations of market behavior
- Agent performance comparisons

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
This project showcases:
- **Multi-agent coordination in financial markets**
- **Reinforcement learning in adversarial environments**
- Direct relevance to **algorithmic trading firms** like Hudson River Trading
